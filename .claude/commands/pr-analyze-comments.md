# Analyze PR Comments

Analyzes PR review comments and presents numbered action items that you can easily select to fix.

## Usage
```
/pr-analyze-comments <pr_number>
```

## Purpose
Gets PR review comments and presents them as numbered action items so you can say "fix 1,5,9" etc.

Notes:
- Reviews may include comments from multiple bots (Claude and Codex). Treat both as authoritative inputs for parsing/resolution.

## What This Command Does

1. Requires a PR number to be provided
2. Fetches PR review data using GitHub CLI
3. Analyzes what needs to be done with AI assistance
4. Presents as numbered list with priority markers

**Note**: If no PR number is provided, the command will ask for one.

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Validate and Fetch PR Data
1. **Validate PR Number**: Ensure PR number is provided

2. **Get PR Basic Info**:
```bash
gh pr view <pr_number> --json number,title,state,url
```

3. **Fetch All Review Comments**:
```bash
# Get inline review comments on code
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr_number>/comments --jq '.[] | {
  id: .id,
  path: .path,
  line: .line,
  body: .body,
  user: .user.login,
  created_at: .created_at,
  in_reply_to_id: .in_reply_to_id
}'

# Get top-level review comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<pr_number>/reviews --jq '.[] | select(.state != "DISMISSED") | {
  id: .id,
  body: .body,
  user: .user.login,
  state: .state,
  submitted_at: .submitted_at
}'

# Get general issue comments
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/<pr_number>/comments --jq '.[] | {
  id: .id,
  body: .body,
  user: .user.login,
  created_at: .created_at
}'
```

4. **Get Repository Context**:
```bash
gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '{owner: .owner.login, name: .name}'
```

### Phase 2: Analyze and Categorize Comments
5. **Parse Comments**: Extract actionable feedback from:
   - Bot review comments (@github-actions, @claude, @codex, @github-advanced-security)
   - Human reviewer comments
   - Filter out:
     - Resolved/outdated comments
     - Auto-generated stack comments (Graphite, etc.)
     - Success/acknowledgment messages

6. **Categorize by Priority**:
   - **üî¥ CRITICAL/BLOCKING**: Security issues, bugs that break functionality, test failures
   - **üü° IMPORTANT**: Missing features, significant improvements, maintainability issues
   - **üîµ NICE TO HAVE**: Code style, minor optimizations, suggestions

7. **Structure Each Item**:
   ```
   [N] Issue Type - file.ext:line
       @reviewer: "exact quote from comment"
       Context: explanation why this matters
       Fix: specific implementation steps
       Effort: ~X min | Files: path/to/files
   ```

### Phase 3: DISPLAY AND STOP
8. Present the analysis in this format:
   ```
   PR #[number]: [title]
   Status: X outstanding issues

   üî¥ CRITICAL/BLOCKING (X items) - Must fix before merge
   [1] Issue Type - file.ext:line
       @reviewer: "exact quote from comment"
       Context: explanation why this matters
       Fix: specific implementation steps
       Effort: ~X min | Files: path/to/files

   üü° IMPORTANT (X items) - Should fix
   [N] Issue Type - file.ext:line
       @reviewer: "exact quote"
       Context: explanation
       Fix: implementation steps
       Effort: ~X min | Files: paths

   üîµ NICE TO HAVE (X items) - Optional improvements
   [N] Issue Type - file.ext:line
       @reviewer: "exact quote"
       Fix: implementation steps
       Effort: ~X min | Files: paths

   Total estimated effort: ~X minutes/hours
   ‚Üí Which should I fix? Reply with numbers (e.g. "1,4", "all critical", or "all"):
   ```

9. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: STOP HERE - DO NOT PROCEED**
   - **WAIT for user to respond with their selection**
   - **DO NOT automatically select items or start fixing**

### Phase 4: USER SELECTION HANDLING (ONLY after user responds)
10. **ONLY AFTER user provides selection** (e.g. "1,4", "all critical"):
    - Parse their selection
    - Create TodoWrite tasks for selected items
    - Then proceed to implement the selected fixes
    - If user says "none" or "skip", acknowledge and stop

## Priority Assignment Guidelines

### üî¥ CRITICAL/BLOCKING
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, exposed secrets)
- Bugs that prevent core functionality from working
- Test failures or missing critical test coverage
- Breaking changes without proper handling
- CI/CD pipeline failures

### üü° IMPORTANT
- Missing error handling for important flows
- Performance issues in key paths
- Missing documentation for public APIs
- Code duplication or maintainability concerns
- Missing permissions or access controls

### üîµ NICE TO HAVE
- Code style suggestions
- Minor optimizations
- Improved naming
- Additional edge case handling
- Refactoring suggestions

## Example Usage

```bash
# Review specific PR
/pr-analyze-comments 5

# If no PR number provided, you'll be asked:
/pr-analyze-comments
‚Üí "Please provide a PR number to review (e.g., /pr-analyze-comments 5)"
```

## Notes

- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh api`) for fetching review data
- Analyzes comments from bots (@claude, @codex) and human reviewers
- Automatically categorizes by priority based on content
- User maintains control over what gets fixed
- Integration with TodoWrite for task tracking

## Related Commands
- `/pr-deep-review` - Deep agent investigation before implementing
- `/commit` - Commit fixes after implementation
- `/pr-request-review` - Request new review after fixes
