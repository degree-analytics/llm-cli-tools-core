### TaskMaster Commands (`/tm/*`)

The TaskMaster suite provides comprehensive task management:

```bash
/tm/help              # Show all TM commands
/tm/next              # Get next priority task
/tm/add              # Add new task
/tm/board            # Visual task board
/tm/workflows/daily  # Daily standup workflow
```

See `@.claude/TM_COMMANDS_GUIDE.md` for complete TaskMaster documentation.

## Command Structure

Each command file follows this structure:

```markdown
# Command Name

Brief description of what the command does.

## Usage
```
/command-name [required-arg] [optional-arg]
```

## Purpose
Detailed explanation of when and why to use this command.

## Implementation
Step-by-step workflow the command follows:

1. **Phase 1**: Description
   - Specific actions
   - Tools used

2. **Phase 2**: Description
   - More actions
   - Verification steps

## Examples
Concrete usage examples with expected outcomes.

## Safety Considerations
Any warnings or safety checks.

## Related Commands
Links to similar or complementary commands.
```

## Creating Custom Commands

### 1. Create Command File

```bash
# Use the create-command helper
/create-command

# Or manually create
touch .claude/commands/my-command.md
```

### 2. Define Command Structure

```markdown
# My Command

What this command does.

## Usage
```
/my-command <required> [optional]
```

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Setup
1. Validate inputs
2. Check prerequisites
3. Load necessary context

### Phase 2: Execution
1. Main logic here
2. Use appropriate tools
3. Verify results

### Phase 3: Cleanup
1. Update documentation
2. Commit changes
3. Report results
```

### 3. Command Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each command does one thing well
2. **Verification Focus** - Always include verification steps
3. **Safety First** - Check before destructive operations
4. **Clear Documentation** - Examples and use cases
5. **Tool Integration** - Prefer justfile commands over raw tools

### 4. Testing Commands

Before adding to the repository:
1. Test with various inputs
2. Verify safety checks work
3. Ensure idempotency where possible
4. Document edge cases

## Command Patterns

### Workflow Commands
Commands that orchestrate multi-step processes:
- Start with context gathering
- Execute in clear phases
- Include verification between phases
- End with cleanup/documentation

### Analysis Commands
Commands that provide insights:
- Fetch data from multiple sources
- Process and correlate information
- Present actionable findings
- Suggest next steps

### Automation Commands
Commands that automate repetitive tasks:
- Replace manual command sequences
- Include error handling
- Provide progress feedback
- Support dry-run mode

## Integration with Project Workflows

Commands integrate with:
- **TaskMaster** - Task tracking and status updates
- **Justfile** - Standardized command execution
- **Git/GT** - Version control operations
- **Linear** - Issue tracking synchronization
- **CI/CD** - Build and deployment automation

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found
```bash
# List all commands
ls -la .claude/commands/

# Check command name spelling
ls .claude/commands/ | grep -i commandname
```

### Command Fails
1. Check prerequisites (API keys, tools installed)
2. Verify current directory is project root
3. Review command implementation for issues
4. Check related tool availability

### Creating Command Issues
- Ensure markdown formatting is valid
- Check file permissions
- Verify command doesn't conflict with existing ones

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the command system:
- Command aliases for common variations
- Parameter validation framework
- Command composition/chaining
- Performance metrics tracking
- Command version management
